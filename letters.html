            <p>I'm so glad we've made this far. I love you more than words can say.</p>
            
            <p>It only felt like yesterday when we first met. I stil remember how happy we were, singing our hearts to High School Musical that day. I'm so thankful we both joined that vc, it brought us together in the most unexpected way, from being friends to lovers.</p>
            
            <p>You've shown me what true love means. That it's not just about romance, it's about acceptance, patience, and walking through every ups and downs. No matter what life throws our way, I know we'll face it together, stronger than ever.</p>
            
            <p>Yours always and forever,<br>Your best boy.</p>
